# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive role-based access control for the RestaurantPro application with 4 distinct roles: Administrator, Manager, Server, and Kitchen Staff.

## Components Created

### 1. Permission System (`src/lib/role-permissions.ts`)

- Defines permissions for each role with page and action-level granularity
- **Administrator**: Full access to all features
- **Manager**: All features except user deletion
- **Server**: Orders, tables, reservations, and view-only access to menu/inventory
- **Kitchen Staff**: Order status updates and view-only access to menu/inventory

### 2. Permission Hook (`src/hooks/use-permissions.tsx`)

- `hasPageAccess(page)`: Check if user can access a page
- `hasActionAccess(page, action)`: Check if user can perform specific actions
- `getNavigationItems()`: Get filtered navigation based on role

### 3. Protected Route Component (`src/components/restaurant/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

- Wraps all routes to enforce page-level access control
- Redirects unauthorized users to appropriate pages

### 4. Permission Guard Component (`src/components/restaurant/PermissionGuard.tsx`)

- Fine-grained component-level access control
- Hides UI elements based on user permissions
- Usage: `<PermissionGuard page="orders" action="create">...</PermissionGuard>`

## Pages Updated with Permissions

### Orders Page (`src/pages/Orders.tsx`)

- ✅ New Order button: `page="orders" action="create"`
- ✅ Status change buttons: `page="orders" action="edit"`
- ✅ Payment processing: `page="orders" action="payment"`

### Menu Page (`src/pages/Menu.tsx`)

- ✅ Add Menu Item: `page="menu" action="create"`
- ✅ Edit Menu Item: `page="menu" action="edit"`
- ✅ Delete Menu Item: `page="menu" action="delete"`

### Tables Page (`src/pages/Tables.tsx`)

- ✅ Table status changes: `page="tables" action="edit"`
- ✅ Reservations: `page="tables" action="reserve"`

### Inventory Page (`src/pages/Inventory.tsx`)

- ✅ Add Inventory Item: `page="inventory" action="create"`
- ✅ Restock Items: `page="inventory" action="restock"`

### Users Page (`src/pages/Users.tsx`)

- ✅ Add User: `page="users" action="create"`
- ✅ Edit User: `page="users" action="edit"`

### Reports Page (`src/pages/Reports.tsx`)

- ✅ Export Reports: `page="reports" action="export"`

## Navigation Updates (`src/components/restaurant/RestaurantLayout.tsx`)

- ✅ Dynamic navigation filtering based on user role
- ✅ Only shows accessible menu items

## App Routing (`src/App.tsx`)

- ✅ All routes wrapped with `ProtectedRoute` components
- ✅ Page-level access control enforced

## Test Users Available

1. **Administrator** (emma@restaurant.com)

   - Full access to all features
   - Can create/edit/delete users, menu items, process payments, etc.

2. **Manager** (carol@restaurant.com)

   - Cannot delete users, but has access to most other features
   - Can view reports, manage inventory, etc.

3. **Server** (alice@restaurant.com)

   - Can create and manage orders
   - Can manage table status and reservations
   - View-only access to menu and inventory

4. **Kitchen Staff** (david@restaurant.com)
   - Can update order status (pending → preparing → ready → served)
   - View-only access to menu and inventory
   - Limited navigation (only Orders, Menu, and Inventory pages)

## Testing the RBAC System

1. **Login as different users** to see different navigation menus
2. **Try restricted actions** - buttons should be hidden for unauthorized users
3. **Test page access** - unauthorized users should be redirected
4. **Verify role-specific features**:
   - Servers can't see Users or Reports pages
   - Kitchen Staff can only see limited pages
   - Managers can't delete users but can do everything else
   - Administrators have full access

## Features Working

- ✅ Page-level access control
- ✅ Action-level permission guards
- ✅ Dynamic navigation filtering
- ✅ Role-based UI component visibility
- ✅ Proper redirect handling for unauthorized access
- ✅ Server preselection for order creation
- ✅ Complete permission matrix implementation

## Security Notes

- All permission checks are client-side for demo purposes
- In production, server-side validation would be required
- Role permissions are easily configurable in `role-permissions.ts`
- Permission system is extensible for additional roles/permissions

The RBAC implementation is now complete and fully functional!
